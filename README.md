# Whiteboarding-DBC-Chicago

This is the repository containing all questions, solutions, and presentations for Whiteboarding Sessions for DBC Chicago.

## Uploading Materials

Naming: Please name all files in the following manner:

`<topic>_<material type>_<challenge name (if applicable)>_<question or solution (if applicable>_<your github name>`

Questions should only be uploaded when you have a correct/working solution uploaded at the same time.

## Presentations

Feel free to use given powerpoints or tweak/create one to your own preferences, but rename and upload your presentation as well. Try to keep presentations to roughly 15 minutes long since we want to spend as much time whiteboarding as possible. Picking out examples of familiar challenges that cover your topic is helpful for current/former students.


Please contact Glenna Mowry @gmmowry or Dalal Alrayes @dalrayes if you have any questions! :)
